# bt-react-test-newsapi
React Test set by Adrian Boyle and Greg Hall for the upcoming Grade D Front End Development role. Utilizes NewsAPI.

# Tech Stack
This version of the BT NewsAPI App uses **NewsAPI** as the primary service.
The environment is built off of **yarn**, combined with **Babel** in order to serve the backend proxy server.
The UI is coded in **React**, using **TypeScript**. All code is written as per **ES6 JavaScript** by base. The styles are _**temporarily**_ coded in **CSS** (Planned to migrate to **SCSS** shortly). Backend proxy server code written in **Node** + **JavaScript**.

# Justification for the Tech Stack
Justification is that this setup largely emulates what we use on a basic level in production at EE. It's partly because I'm already proficient with it, but also to show my ability to replicate this setup on a more individual scale.

# Considerations and Current Bugs
Please view the Issues tab for the current bug list. Bugs will be listed as _**BUG-100**_ for the first issue, incrementing (Second issue would be _**BUG-101**_ and so forth).
Also please note that this application is version controlled via the Major-Minor-Patch version control system, and will eventually be converted to BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) class names for the SCSS conversion. The initial version first commited is _**v1.0.0**_.
